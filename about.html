                Hi, my name is Reda. I'm a first-year Software Engineering student at
                <strong>Shandong University of Science and Technology</strong>. I’ve always been passionate about technology and creativity, and I enjoy building projects that allow me to learn, grow, and express my ideas. From designing websites to creating
                mini-games in C++ and experimenting with new tools, I love exploring different areas of software development. I believe in continuous learning and improvement, so every project I work on is not only about results, but also about becoming
                a better developer step by step. Outside of coding, I’m very active — I go to the gym regularly, enjoy traveling, and exploring new cultures. My goal is to become a skilled software engineer who can create meaningful projects that make
                an impact while also living a balanced and fulfilling life.
